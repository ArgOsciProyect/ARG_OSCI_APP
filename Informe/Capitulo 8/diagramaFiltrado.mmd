    Input->>Strategy: Raw data points
    Note over Strategy: Strategy Pattern<br>enables multiple filters
    alt Butterworth Selected
        Strategy->>Butter: Apply filter
        Note over Butter: Configure parameters<br>fc = 50kHz
        Butter->>Butter: Forward pass
        alt Double filtering
            Butter->>Butter: Extend signal by reflection
            Butter->>Butter: Reverse pass
            Note over Butter: Zero-phase response
        end
        Butter-->>Strategy: Filtered signal
    else Moving Average Selected
        Strategy->>MA: Apply filter
        Note over MA: Configure window size
        MA->>MA: Uniform convolution
        MA-->>Strategy: Filtered signal
    else New Filter Type
        Strategy->>Other: Apply filter
        Note over Other: Implement FilterType<br>interface

    Note over Strategy,Output: Easy addition of new<br>filter types through<br>Strategy Pattern
