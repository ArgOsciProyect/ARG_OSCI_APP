# SetupProvider.dart Documentation

## Overview

`SetupProvider.dart` implements a state management solution for the device setup process in the app, using the GetX framework. This class serves as the bridge between the UI and the underlying `SetupService`, managing the state transitions during the WiFi configuration process.

## Class Structure

### SetupProvider Class

The `SetupProvider` class extends `GetxController` from the GetX framework, which provides reactive state management capabilities. It maintains the setup state and exposes methods to modify this state during the device configuration workflow.

## Key Components

1. **State Management**:
   - Uses an observable (`Rx`) `SetupState` object to track the current state of the setup process
   - Provides a `_updateState()` method to modify state in a controlled manner
   - Exposes state and available networks through getter methods

2. **Setup Service Integration**:
   - Holds a reference to a `SetupService` instance that handles low-level networking operations
   - Delegates network operations to the service while managing state updates

3. **Retry Logic**:
   - Implements connection retry logic with a configurable maximum number of attempts
   - Provides appropriate error handling and status updates during retry operations

## Main Functionality

### Local Access Point Connection

The `connectToLocalAP()` method initiates a connection to the device's local access point. It updates the state to reflect the connection process and handles any errors that might occur.

### WiFi Network Scanning

The `handleExternalAPSelection()` method triggers a scan for available WiFi networks. It updates the state to indicate scanning is in progress and populates the state with discovered networks when complete.

### External Network Connection

The `connectToExternalAP(ssid, password)` method:

1. Encrypts WiFi credentials using the device's public key
2. Attempts to connect the ESP32 device to the specified WiFi network
3. Implements retry logic for failed connection attempts
4. Updates state throughout the process to reflect progress
5. Handles errors and provides descriptive error messages

### Network Change Handling

After initiating a WiFi connection:

1. `waitForNetworkChange(ssid)` monitors for the WiFi connection change
2. `handleNetworkChangeAndConnect(ssid, password)` establishes a connection to the device over the new network

### State Reset

The `reset()` method clears the current state and returns it to initial values, allowing the setup process to be restarted if needed.

## Error Handling

The provider implements comprehensive error handling:

- Catches exceptions from all network operations
- Updates state with descriptive error messages
- Uses rethrow to propagate errors to callers when appropriate
- Provides retry mechanisms for transient failures

## Integration with UI

While not directly visible in this file, the reactive state is designed to be consumed by UI components that respond to state changes, showing appropriate progress indicators, error messages, and network selection options based on the current state.

# SetupService.dart Documentation

## Overview

`SetupService.dart` is a core file in the device setup process, containing three key classes:

1. `NetworkInfoService` - Handles WiFi network detection and connection
2. `SetupService` - Implements the `SetupRepository` interface to manage device configuration and communication
3. `SetupException` - Custom exception class for setup-related errors

The file provides comprehensive functionality for connecting to ESP32 devices, scanning for WiFi networks, and configuring device communications.

## NetworkInfoService Class

`NetworkInfoService` is responsible for low-level WiFi network operations, particularly focusing on connecting to ESP32 access points.

### Key Features

- Manages default and custom ESP32 access point credentials
- Provides multi-strategy connection approaches with retries
- Verifies connections with HTTP tests
- Supports platform-specific connection behaviors

### Connection Workflow

1. The service first attempts connection using the WiFiForIoTPlugin (Android only)
2. If that fails, it falls back to traditional SSID verification
3. Both approaches implement retry logic with appropriate delays
4. Connection verification is performed via HTTP test requests

### Methods

- `connectWithRetries()` - Orchestrates the retry process for ESP32 connection
- `testConnection()` - Verifies connection through HTTP test requests
- `connectToESP32()` - Implements the multi-strategy connection approach
- `getWifiName()` / `getWifiIP()` - Retrieves network information
- `isConnectedToNetwork()` - Checks connection to a specific network

## SetupService Class

`SetupService` implements the `SetupRepository` interface and acts as the main service for device setup and configuration. It handles secure communications, network scanning, and connection management.

### Key Features

- RSA encryption for secure credential transmission
- WiFi network scanning and connection
- Network mode selection (internal/external)
- Connection verification with encrypted challenge-response
- Cross-platform connection approaches

### RSA Security Workflow

1. Retrieves the device's public RSA key
2. Encrypts sensitive data (WiFi credentials) before transmission
3. Uses encrypted challenge-response for connection verification

### Setup Process

1. Connect to the ESP32's access point
2. Scan for available WiFi networks
3. Send encrypted credentials for the selected network
4. Wait for the ESP32 to connect to the selected network
5. Establish connection to ESP32 through the new network

### Methods

- `connectToLocalAP()` - Connects to the ESP32's local access point
- `scanForWiFiNetworks()` - Retrieves available WiFi networks and gets public key
- `encriptWithPublicKey()` - Encrypts data using the device's RSA public key
- `connectToWiFi()` - Sends encrypted credentials to the ESP32
- `waitForNetworkChange()` - Waits for successful network transition
- `handleNetworkChangeAndConnect()` - Establishes connection through the new network

### Platform-Specific Behavior

- For Android: Uses WiFiForIoTPlugin for automatic connection
- For iOS and others: Provides user guidance for manual connection and waits for connection detection

## SetupException Class

A custom exception class that encapsulates setup-related errors, providing clear error messages for debugging and user feedback.

## Technical Details

### Connection Management

- The service maintains global HTTP and Socket configurations
- Connection settings are updated dynamically as network changes occur

- Public key retrieval and secure storage

The file demonstrates a robust approach to handling the complex process of device setup with appropriate retry logic, error handling, and security measures.

# SetupStatus.dart Documentation

## Overview

`SetupStatus.dart` defines the state management components used to track the progress of device setup in the application. It contains two main elements: the `SetupStatus` enum and the `SetupState` class.

## SetupStatus Enum

The `SetupStatus` enum represents the various stages a device can go through during the setup process. This provides a type-safe way to track setup progress throughout the app.

### Defined Stages

1. **initial**: The starting state before any setup actions begin
2. **connecting**: The app is attempting to connect to the device's access point
3. **scanning**: The app is scanning for available WiFi networks
4. **selecting**: User interaction stage - selecting from available networks
5. **configuring**: The app is sending the selected network configuration to the device
6. **waitingForNetworkChange**: The app is waiting for the device to connect to the selected network
7. **error**: An error occurred during the setup process
8. **success**: The current setup step completed successfully
9. **completed**: The entire setup process has been completed successfully

This enum allows the application to track exactly which stage of setup the device is in and render appropriate UI components based on that status.

## SetupState Class

`SetupState` is an immutable class that encapsulates all information about the current state of the setup process. Using an immutable state design pattern allows for predictable state transitions and makes it easier to track state changes.

### Properties

- **status**: The current stage in the setup process (using the `SetupStatus` enum)
- **error**: Optional error message if setup failed
- **canRetry**: Boolean flag indicating whether the current error state can be retried
- **networks**: List of available WiFi networks discovered during scanning

### Methods

#### Constructor

The default constructor creates a new state object with optional parameters, defaulting to the initial state with no error, retry enabled, and an empty networks list.

#### copyWith

The `copyWith` method implements the immutable state pattern, allowing for creating a new state instance that's a copy of the current state but with specific properties changed. This enables state transitions without modifying the original state object.

### Usage Pattern

The `SetupState` is designed to be used with state management solutions (likely GetX based on imports in other files). This pattern allows for:

1. Tracking the full setup flow from initial connection to completion
2. Preserving error information when failures occur
3. Maintaining a list of available networks for selection
4. Supporting retry operations for recoverable errors
5. Creating new state instances for each status change without mutating existing state

This immutable state approach helps ensure consistency across the UI and prevents race conditions during asynchronous operations in the setup process.

# WiFiCredentials.dart Documentation

## Overview

`WiFiCredentials.dart` defines a data model that represents WiFi network credentials (SSID and password) with serialization capabilities. This model facilitates secure transmission of network credentials during the device configuration process.

## WiFiCredentials Class

The `WiFiCredentials` class is a simple data model that encapsulates network identification and authentication information.

### Properties

- **ssid**: String representing the network name (SSID)
- **password**: String representing the network password

### Methods

#### Constructor

Creates a new instance with the provided SSID and password.

#### fromJson Factory

Deserializes WiFi credentials from a JSON map structure. It:

- Validates that required fields ('SSID' and 'Password') exist in the input map
- Throws a `FormatException` if fields are missing
- Creates and returns a new `WiFiCredentials` instance with values from the map

#### toJson Method

Serializes the credentials into a JSON-compatible map structure with 'SSID' and 'Password' keys, suitable for API communication.

#### toString Override

Provides a string representation of the credentials, showing only the SSID for security reasons (omitting the password).

### Usage in Context

Based on other files in the application context, the `WiFiCredentials` class is used to:

1. Transport encrypted credentials when configuring ESP32 devices with WiFi settings
2. Serialize credentials for sending to the device via HTTP requests
3. Deserialize credentials when necessary from API responses
4. Handle error cases when malformed credential data is encountered

The class is designed with security in mind, avoiding exposing passwords in log outputs through its toString implementation.

As seen in the `SetupService` class, these credentials are likely encrypted using RSA before transmission to ensure secure configuration of the device over potentially insecure initial connections.

# SocketConnection.dart Documentation

## Overview

The `SocketConnection.dart` file defines a reactive model class that manages socket connection parameters for the oscilloscope application. It serves as a key component in the networking infrastructure, enabling real-time connectivity between the mobile application and the oscilloscope device.

## Class Structure

### SocketConnection Class

`SocketConnection` extends the GetX framework's `GetxController` class to leverage reactive state management capabilities. This design choice allows connection parameters to automatically notify dependent UI components when changes occur, ensuring synchronization between the application state and the user interface.

## Properties

The class maintains two primary properties:

1. **IP Address (`ip`)**
   - Implemented as a reactive string (`RxString`) from the GetX framework
   - Stores the target device's IP address (e.g., "192.168.1.100")
   - Changes to this property automatically trigger UI updates in connected components

2. **Port Number (`port`)**
   - Implemented as a reactive integer (`RxInt`) from the GetX framework
   - Stores the numerical port value for socket communication (e.g., 8080)
   - Reactive by design to propagate changes throughout the application

## Functionality

### Construction and Initialization

The class provides two ways to initialize connection parameters:

1. **Standard Constructor**
   - Creates a new instance with explicitly provided IP and port values
   - Wraps these values in GetX reactive containers (`.obs`)
   - Example: `SocketConnection("192.168.1.100", 8080)`

2. **Factory Constructor (fromJson)**
   - Deserializes connection parameters from a JSON map structure
   - Expects a map containing 'ip' and 'port' keys
   - Facilitates loading connection settings from stored configurations

### Data Persistence

The `toJson()` method enables serialization of the connection parameters:

- Extracts the current values from the reactive containers
- Creates a structured map with 'ip' and 'port' keys
- Returns a JSON-compatible representation for storage or network transfer

### State Management

The `updateConnection()` method provides a unified way to modify connection parameters:

- Takes new IP and port values as parameters
- Updates both reactive properties atomically
- Automatically triggers reactivity for all observers
- Provides a clean API for connection changes from other parts of the application

## Technical Implementation Details

The implementation leverages GetX reactivity through several key mechanisms:

1. **Reactive Properties**
   - Uses `.obs` extensions to make values observable
   - Maintains the original type safety (String for IP, int for port)
   - Allows direct value access through `.value` property

2. **GetxController Integration**
   - Extends GetxController to integrate with the broader GetX ecosystem
   - Enables dependency injection and lifecycle management
   - Supports memory management through controller disposal

3. **Update Propagation**
   - Changes to `ip.value` or `port.value` automatically notify dependent widgets
   - No manual notification or rebuilding required
   - Ensures UI consistency with the application state

## Usage Context

Within the broader application architecture, the `SocketConnection` class serves multiple important roles:

1. **Configuration Storage**
   - Maintains the current target device connection information
   - Provides serialization for persistent storage between app sessions

2. **Service Configuration**
   - Used by the `SocketService` to establish actual socket connections
   - Provides the necessary parameters for TCP/IP communication

3. **UI Integration**
   - Supports reactive UI updates when connection details change
   - Enables form binding for connection setting screens

The class exemplifies clean separation of concerns by focusing solely on managing connection parameters while delegating actual socket communication to the `SocketService` class.

# HttpConfig.dart Documentation

## Overview

`HttpConfig.dart` defines a configuration model class for the HTTP client settings used throughout the oscilloscope application. This file provides a structured way to manage HTTP connection settings, particularly the base URL for API endpoints and the HTTP client instance. It serves as a fundamental building block for the application's networking layer.

## Class Structure

### HttpConfig Class

The `HttpConfig` class is a data model that encapsulates the configuration needed for making HTTP requests to the oscilloscope device's API. It follows an immutable pattern, with all fields being final, ensuring configuration stability during runtime.

## Properties

The class defines two primary properties:

1. **baseUrl**
   - A String containing the base URL for all API requests
   - Typically includes protocol, IP address, and port (e.g., "<http://192.168.1.100:8080>")
   - Used as a prefix for all HTTP endpoint paths
   - Critical for directing requests to the correct oscilloscope device

2. **client**
   - An optional `http.Client` instance from the `package:http/http.dart` library
   - Used to make the actual HTTP requests
   - Can be injected for testing purposes or custom configuration
   - If not provided, a default client is automatically created

## Core Functionality

### Construction and Initialization

The class provides multiple ways to create instances:

1. **Default Constructor**
   - Takes a required baseUrl parameter
   - Accepts an optional client parameter
   - Creates a default HTTP client if none is provided
   - Example: `HttpConfig('http://192.168.1.100:80')`

2. **FromJson Factory**
   - Creates an instance from a JSON map
   - Requires 'baseUrl' key in the map
   - Optional 'client' key to indicate if a client should be created
   - Throws FormatException if required data is missing
   - Used for deserialization from stored settings

### Serialization Support

The class supports serialization for persistence or transfer:

1. **toJson Method**
   - Converts the configuration to a JSON-compatible map
   - Includes 'baseUrl' and a flag indicating if a client exists
   - Does not serialize the actual client instance (as this wouldn't be meaningful)
   - Used for saving configuration or sending between components

### Instance Manipulation

For reconfiguration without mutating the original instance:

1. **copyWith Method**
   - Creates a new instance with selectively changed properties
   - Follows the immutable object pattern common in Flutter
   - Preserves unchanged properties from the original
   - Useful when only the URL or client needs to be changed

### String Representation

For debugging and logging purposes:

1. **toString Override**
   - Provides a human-readable representation of the configuration
   - Includes the base URL but omits the client (which wouldn't be meaningful in logs)
   - Useful for debugging network issues

## Usage Context

Within the broader application architecture, the `HttpConfig` class serves several important roles:

1. **Service Configuration**
   - Passed to `HttpService` to configure where requests are sent
   - Determines which oscilloscope device the app communicates with
   - Can be updated when moving between different devices or networks

2. **Testing Support**
   - Enables dependency injection of mock clients for unit testing
   - Facilitates test isolation without network dependencies
   - Supports simulated responses for predictable test behavior

3. **Configuration Persistence**
   - JSON serialization allows saving settings between sessions
   - Enables restoring the last used connection configuration
   - Supports storing multiple device configurations

4. **Dynamic Reconfiguration**
   - Supports changing the target API endpoint at runtime
   - Used during device setup process when IP address changes
   - Enables seamless transition between different network contexts

This configuration class exemplifies clean separation of concerns by isolating connection settings from the actual HTTP request logic, making the application more maintainable and testable.

# DataAcquisitionProvider.dart Documentation

## Overview

`DataAcquisitionProvider.dart` is a key component in the oscilloscope application that acts as the intermediary layer between the UI components and the lower-level `DataAcquisitionService`. This provider implements the GetX pattern for state management, handling the reactive updates, data transformation, and user interactions required for real-time oscilloscope functionality.

## Core Architecture

The provider follows a mediator pattern, implementing bidirectional communication:

1. **Downstream Communication**: Propagates UI state changes (e.g., trigger settings, filter configurations) to the underlying service
2. **Upstream Communication**: Processes data from the service (waveform data, measurements) and delivers it to UI components

The class extends `GetxController` to leverage GetX's reactive state management capabilities, allowing UI components to automatically update when values change.

## Key Components

### State Management

The provider maintains several types of reactive state variables:

1. **Service Mirror Values**: Properties that reflect the current state of the acquisition service (e.g., `triggerLevel`, `triggerEdge`, `useHysteresis`)
2. **UI Configuration Values**: Settings primarily used by the UI (e.g., `currentFilter`, `windowSize`, `alpha`)
3. **Measurement Values**: Data calculated from the acquired signal (e.g., `frequency`, `maxValue`)
4. **Control Flags**: Internal state flags for preventing circular updates and tracking initialization (`_updatingFromService`, `_initialized`)

### Data Flow

The provider implements a complete data pipeline:

1. **Data Acquisition**: Initiates data collection via the service from the oscilloscope device
2. **Data Processing**: Applies filters and transformations to raw waveform data
3. **Data Distribution**: Publishes processed data through streams to connected UI components
4. **Measurement Extraction**: Extracts and publishes key signal measurements (frequency, amplitude)

### Stream Management

The provider manages several data streams:

1. **Data Points Stream**: Delivers processed waveform data to charts and displays
2. **Frequency Stream**: Provides real-time frequency measurements
3. **Maximum Value Stream**: Tracks signal amplitude values

All streams are properly initialized, managed, and disposed of during the provider's lifecycle.

## Synchronization Mechanism

One of the provider's most important functions is maintaining bidirectional synchronization between UI state and service state:

1. **Service-to-Provider Sync**: Through `_syncValuesFromService()`, the provider pulls current values from the service to ensure its state reflects the actual device configuration
2. **Provider-to-Service Sync**: Through reactive listeners established in `_setupValueChangeListeners()`, changes in the provider's state are automatically propagated to the service

To prevent circular updates, the provider uses the `_updatingFromService` flag to distinguish between user-initiated changes and service-synchronized changes.

## Filter System

The provider implements an extensible signal processing system:

1. **Filter Selection**: Allows changing between different filter algorithms (Low Pass, Moving Average, Exponential)
2. **Parameter Configuration**: Exposes methods to modify filter parameters (window size, alpha, cutoff frequency)
3. **Filter Application**: The `_applyFilter()` method processes raw data points using the selected filter with the current parameters
4. **Double Filtering**: Supports an optional second pass filtering for stronger noise reduction

## Trigger Management

The provider handles the oscilloscope's trigger system:

1. **Trigger Level**: Controls the voltage threshold at which to trigger
2. **Trigger Edge**: Manages whether to trigger on rising or falling edges
3. **Trigger Mode**: Switches between normal (continuous) and single modes
4. **Mode-Specific Actions**: Each mode change triggers appropriate UI actions (clearing charts, resetting offsets)

## Socket and Configuration Management

The provider monitors and responds to changes in:

1. **Socket Connection**: Restarts data acquisition when connection parameters change
2. **Device Configuration**: Updates dependent values when device configuration changes
3. **Voltage Scales**: Validates current scale against available scales from the device

## Error Handling

The provider implements comprehensive error handling:

1. **Stream Error Handling**: All stream subscriptions include error handlers
2. **Critical Error Handling**: The `handleCriticalError()` method provides a structured way to handle unrecoverable errors
3. **Service Call Protection**: All service method calls are wrapped in try-catch blocks

## Technical Integration Points

The provider integrates with several other components:

1. **DataAcquisitionService**: For low-level data acquisition and device communication
2. **OscilloscopeChartProvider**: For chart display configuration and control
3. **DeviceConfigProvider**: For device-specific configuration parameters
4. **UserSettingsProvider**: For user preference monitoring
5. **SetupScreen**: For navigation during critical errors

This strategic position in the application architecture makes the DataAcquisitionProvider a crucial component in delivering a responsive, robust oscilloscope experience to the user.

data_point.dart

 Documentation

## Overview

data_point.dart

 defines the fundamental data structure used throughout the oscilloscope application for representing individual measurement points. This model serves as the basic unit of information exchanged between data acquisition, processing, and visualization components.

## Core Data Structure

The file defines the `DataPoint` class, which encapsulates the x-y coordinates of a measurement point along with metadata about the point's characteristics. This design supports both time-domain (oscilloscope) and frequency-domain (FFT) visualizations within the application.

## Key Properties

Each `DataPoint` instance contains four essential properties:

1. **x-coordinate**: Represents time (in seconds) for oscilloscope mode or frequency (in Hz) for FFT mode. This property is mutable to support post-acquisition transformations like trigger alignment.

2. **y-coordinate**: Represents voltage (in volts) for oscilloscope mode or magnitude (in dB) for FFT mode. This is immutable as it represents the actual measured value.

3. **isTrigger**: A boolean flag indicating whether this particular point triggered the oscilloscope acquisition. Used to highlight trigger points in visualizations and to correctly align waveforms.

4. **isInterpolated**: A boolean flag indicating whether this point was mathematically interpolated (not directly measured). This distinguishes between actual measurements and calculated points used for smooth visualizations.

## Serialization Support

The `DataPoint` class implements JSON serialization and deserialization through:

1. **fromJson factory constructor**: Converts a JSON map to a `DataPoint` instance, with graceful handling of missing flags through default values.

2. **toJson method**: Converts a `DataPoint` instance to a JSON-serializable map, preserving all properties including metadata flags.

This serialization capability enables:

- Storing measurement data for later analysis
- Transmitting data between different parts of the application
- Potentially exporting data to external systems

## Usage Context

Within the oscilloscope application, `DataPoint` instances flow through the following components:

1. **Data Acquisition**: Raw measurements are initially captured as `DataPoint` objects
2. **Signal Processing**: Points are processed through filters and transformations
3. **Trigger Detection**: Certain points are marked as triggers based on signal conditions
4. **Visualization**: Points are rendered on charts with special handling for trigger points
5. **Analysis**: Statistics and measurements are performed on collections of points

The simplicity and clarity of this model make it an essential building block for the entire oscilloscope functionality.

#

voltage_scale.dart

 Documentation

## Overview

voltage_scale.dart

 implements the voltage scaling system for the oscilloscope application, providing a structured way to represent and calculate voltage display ranges. This system is crucial for accurately mapping raw ADC values to real-world voltage measurements.

## Core Components

The file defines two complementary classes:

1. **VoltageScales**: A utility class that provides predefined voltage scale configurations
2. **VoltageScale**: A model class representing a specific voltage measurement range

## Predefined Scales

The `VoltageScales` class serves as a repository of standard voltage scales commonly used in oscilloscope applications:

- High voltage (±400V)
- Standard voltage (±2V, ±1V)
- Millivolt ranges (±500mV, ±200mV, ±100mV)

These predefined scales offer a familiar set of voltage ranges for users, similar to physical oscilloscopes. The class also provides a `defaultScales` list that serves as a fallback when device-specific scales are unavailable.

## Scale Configuration Model

The `VoltageScale` class represents a specific voltage range configuration with two key properties:

1. **baseRange**: The total voltage span (from negative peak to positive peak) used for internal calculations
2. **displayName**: A user-friendly label showing positive and negative limits (e.g., "1V, -1V")

## Scale Factor Calculation

The most important functionality is provided by the `scale` getter, which:

1. Retrieves device configuration parameters (bit ranges) from the global dependency injection container
2. Calculates the volts-per-bit conversion factor based on the device's ADC range
3. Returns a scaling factor that maps raw integer values to actual voltages

This calculation enables accurate conversion between:

- Raw ADC values from the hardware (typically 0-4095 for a 12-bit ADC)
- Physical voltage values displayed to the user (e.g., ±1V)

## Integration with Device Configuration

The class integrates with the `DeviceConfigProvider` through GetX dependency injection:

1. It accesses the current device configuration to obtain bit range parameters
2. Uses these parameters to dynamically calculate appropriate scaling factors
3. Provides debug output in development mode to trace scaling calculations

## Equality and Utility Methods

The class implements proper equality comparison and hashing to support:

- Collection operations (searching, filtering)
- UI state management (detecting changes in selected scale)
- Dropdown and selection widgets that need to identify the current scale

The implementation provides a clean interface for the application to work with different voltage measurement ranges while abstracting away the complexity of ADC value conversion.

#

unit_format.dart

 Documentation

## Overview

unit_format.dart

 implements a utility for formatting measurement values with appropriate SI (International System of Units) prefixes. This utility ensures that numeric values are displayed with human-readable units across the entire oscilloscope application.

## Core Functionality

The file defines the `UnitFormat` utility class with static methods for formatting values. Its primary purpose is to automatically select appropriate metric prefixes (milli-, micro-, kilo-, etc.) based on the magnitude of the value being formatted.

## SI Prefix System

The class maintains a comprehensive mapping of SI prefix exponents to their corresponding symbols:

- **Small values**: pico (p, 10^-12), nano (n, 10^-9), micro (μ, 10^-6), milli (m, 10^-3)
- **Base unit**: no prefix (10^0)
- **Large values**: kilo (k, 10^3), mega (M, 10^6), giga (G, 10^9), tera (T, 10^12)

This mapping enables automatic selection of the most appropriate prefix based on the value's magnitude.

## Value Formatting Logic

The `formatWithUnit` method implements a sophisticated algorithm that:

1. Handles special cases:
   - Zero values (returns "0" with the base unit)
   - Very small/large values outside the SI prefix range (uses scientific notation)

2. For values within the SI range:
   - Calculates the appropriate power of 10 exponent
   - Rounds to the nearest SI prefix (powers of 3)
   - Scales the value accordingly
   - Appends the correct prefix symbol

3. Implements intelligent decimal precision control:
   - Calculates available space for decimal digits based on integer part length
   - Ensures consistent total display width (typically 3-4 significant digits)
   - Avoids unnecessary trailing zeros

## Display Format

The output format follows international scientific conventions:

- A numeric value with appropriate decimal precision
- A space separator
- The SI prefix (if any) immediately followed by the unit symbol

Examples:

- 0.0012 V → "1.2 mV"
- 1500 Hz → "1.5 kHz"
- 0.000000002 A → "2 nA"

## Usage in Application

This utility is used throughout the oscilloscope application wherever measurements need to be displayed:

- Voltage measurements in the oscilloscope display
- Frequency values in the spectrum analyzer
- Time base settings in the UI controls
- Statistical measurements and indicators

The implementation ensures consistent, readable, and technically correct representation of all physical quantities across the entire application interface.

#

trigger_data.dart

 Documentation

## Overview

trigger_data.dart

 defines the fundamental trigger configuration enumerations used throughout the oscilloscope application. These enumerations control how the oscilloscope captures and displays waveforms in response to signal conditions.

## Core Enumerations

The file defines two essential enumerations that govern the oscilloscope's triggering behavior:

### TriggerEdge Enumeration

`TriggerEdge` defines the signal transition direction that will activate the trigger:

1. **positive**: The oscilloscope triggers when the signal crosses the trigger threshold in an upward direction (rising edge). This is commonly used to capture waveforms that begin with an upward transition.

2. **negative**: The oscilloscope triggers when the signal crosses the trigger threshold in a downward direction (falling edge). This is useful for capturing waveforms that begin with a downward transition.

This enumeration allows users to select whether the oscilloscope responds to rising or falling signal transitions, similar to physical oscilloscope controls.

### TriggerMode Enumeration

`TriggerMode` defines how the oscilloscope responds after a trigger event occurs:

1. **normal**: The oscilloscope continuously captures and displays new waveforms each time the trigger condition is met. After displaying one waveform, it waits for the next trigger condition to capture the next one. This mode is useful for observing repeating signals.

2. **single**: The oscilloscope captures and displays a single waveform when the trigger condition is met, then stops acquiring new data. This mode is useful for capturing one-time events or for detailed analysis of a specific waveform instance.

## Application Context

These enumerations are used throughout the application:

1. In the user interface, to provide trigger configuration controls
2. In the data acquisition service, to determine how data is captured and processed
3. In the chart providers, to control display behavior after triggering occurs

The simple yet effective design of these enumerations enables a professional oscilloscope triggering system that matches the capabilities of dedicated hardware oscilloscopes.

#

graph_mode.dart

 Documentation

## Overview

graph_mode.dart

 implements the visualization mode system for the oscilloscope application, providing a flexible architecture that supports multiple display modes (time domain and frequency domain). This enables the application to function as both an oscilloscope and a spectrum analyzer.

## Core Architecture

The file defines an abstract base class and two concrete implementations:

1. **GraphMode**: An abstract base class defining the interface for all visualization modes
2. **OscilloscopeMode**: A concrete implementation for time-domain (oscilloscope) visualization
3. **FFTMode**: A concrete implementation for frequency-domain (spectrum analyzer) visualization

This architecture follows the Strategy pattern, allowing the application to switch between different visualization strategies while maintaining a consistent interface.

## Base Interface

The `GraphMode` abstract class defines the common interface that all visualization modes must implement:

- **Identity properties**: `name` and `title` for displaying mode information in the UI
- **Visualization method**: `buildChart()` to construct the appropriate chart widget
- **Control panel flags**: Properties determining which control panels should be visible
- **Lifecycle methods**: `onActivate()` and `onDeactivate()` for managing mode transitions

This abstraction ensures that all visualization modes provide the necessary functionality while allowing customization of behavior and appearance.

## Time Domain Mode

The `OscilloscopeMode` class implements traditional oscilloscope functionality:

- Displays voltage vs. time waveforms
- Enables trigger controls for synchronizing the display to signal events
- Provides time base controls for adjusting the horizontal time scale
- Integrates with `OscilloscopeChartService` for chart data management
- Returns `OscilloscopeChart` widget for rendering the visualization

## Frequency Domain Mode

The `FFTMode` class implements spectrum analyzer functionality:

- Displays amplitude vs. frequency using Fast Fourier Transform
- Hides trigger and timebase controls (not applicable to frequency domain)
- Enables custom controls specific to frequency analysis
- Integrates with `FFTChartService` for spectrum data management
- Returns `FFTChart` widget for rendering the visualization

## Mode Transitions

Both concrete mode classes implement lifecycle methods for smooth transitions:

- `onActivate()`: Called when switching to the mode, resuming data processing
- `onDeactivate()`: Called when leaving the mode, pausing data processing

This ensures that system resources are efficiently managed and that each mode operates only when active.

## Integration with UI

The architecture provides all necessary information for the UI to adapt to the selected mode:

1. The UI queries the current mode for display title and appropriate controls
2. The mode's `buildChart()` method provides the correct visualization component
3. Control panel visibility is determined by the mode's flag properties

This approach creates a clean separation between the visualization modes and the UI framework, making the system extensible for additional modes in the future.

Within the oscilloscope application ecosystem, this provider is a critical component:

1. It's registered early in the application lifecycle using GetX dependency injection
2. Components access it through `Get.find<DeviceConfigProvider>()` to retrieve configuration values
3. The data acquisition service depends on it for packet parsing parameters
4. The display components use it to determine available voltage scales
5. Signal processing relies on its sampling frequency information

This centralized approach ensures consistent device configuration throughout the application, with automatic updates propagating to all components when the configuration changes.

# Filter Types Documentation

## Overview

The

filter_types.dart

 file implements a comprehensive signal processing system for the oscilloscope application. This file provides a collection of digital filters that can be applied to waveform data, enabling signal smoothing, noise reduction, and frequency analysis. The implementation follows established digital signal processing principles with a focus on preserving signal timing characteristics.

## Core Architecture

The file is structured around a flexible object-oriented design pattern:

1. **Abstract Base Class**: The `FilterType` abstract class defines the common interface all filters must implement
2. **Concrete Implementations**: Specific filter types (NoFilter, MovingAverageFilter, etc.) inherit from this base
3. **Shared Mixin**: The `FiltfiltHelper` mixin provides advanced bidirectional filtering capabilities

This architecture allows for easy addition of new filter types while ensuring consistent behavior and usage patterns.

## Bidirectional Filtering Framework

The `FiltfiltHelper` mixin is the technical heart of the system, implementing zero-phase filtering. Key components include:

### Initial State Computation

The `_computeFInitialState` method calculates appropriate initial filter states to minimize boundary effects, using a systematic approach:

- Normalizing filter coefficients
- Computing specific differences based on DC gain
- Creating a carefully crafted initial state vector

This eliminates traditional edge distortions that would otherwise occur during filtering.

### Core Filtering Implementation

The mixin provides three primary filtering methods:

1. **_lfilterWithInit**: Implements a direct-form II transposed structure IIR filter with specified initial conditions, used as the foundational filtering operation

2. **_singleFilt**: Provides single-direction filtering with automatically calculated initial states for continuous signals

3. **_filtfilt**: Implements bidirectional filtering by:
   - Extending the signal through mirror-mode reflection at boundaries
   - Filtering forward through the extended signal
   - Reversing the result and filtering again
   - Extracting the section corresponding to the original signal

This zero-phase filtering approach preserves exact timing information in the signal, which is critical for oscilloscope applications where timing measurements are essential.

## Filter Implementations

### NoFilter

A pass-through filter that returns the input unchanged. This serves as:

- A baseline option for users who don't want any filtering
- A default safe option when other filters cannot be applied
- A control option for comparing filtered vs. unfiltered signals

### MovingAverageFilter

Implements a classic moving average (or box filter) that:

- Averages each point with its neighbors using a specified window size
- Uses a finite impulse response (FIR) design with equal weighting
- Effectively removes high-frequency noise while preserving overall shape
- Preserves DC component (average value) of the signal

### ExponentialFilter

Implements a first-order infinite impulse response (IIR) filter that:

- Applies exponential weighting to past samples
- Controls smoothness through an alpha parameter (smaller values = more smoothing)
- Offers better performance for high window sizes than moving average
- Preserves signal trends more effectively than simple averaging

### LowPassFilter

Implements a second-order Butterworth lowpass filter that:

- Attenuates high frequencies above a specified cutoff frequency
- Provides maximally flat frequency response in the passband
- Uses the bilinear transform to convert analog filter design to digital
- Offers precise control over the frequency content of the signal

## Data Preservation and Processing

A key aspect of the implementation is how it handles data point metadata:

- Each filter preserves the original x-coordinate of every point
- Special point flags like `isTrigger` and `isInterpolated` are preserved
- Only the y-coordinate values are modified by the filtering process

This ensures that important application-specific information (like trigger points) remains intact after filtering.

## Parameter System

The filter system uses a flexible parameter passing approach with a `Map<String, dynamic>` to allow each filter type to accept its specific configuration:

- **Moving Average**: Uses 'windowSize' parameter to set the number of points in the average
- **Exponential**: Uses 'alpha' parameter to control the smoothing factor
- **Low Pass**: Uses 'cutoffFrequency' and 'samplingFrequency' parameters to design the filter

This parameter system allows for runtime configuration of filters without changing the interface.

## Technical Implementation Details

Several technical aspects are noteworthy:

1. **Singleton Pattern**: Each filter implementation uses the singleton pattern to ensure only one instance exists per filter type

2. **Signal Extension**: The bidirectional filtering uses signal reflection at boundaries (mirroring) to minimize edge effects

3. **Efficient Memory Usage**: Filters reuse arrays and buffers where possible to minimize garbage collection

4. **Initial Condition Handling**: The implementation carefully manages filter initial conditions to prevent transient effects

5. **Error Handling**: The code includes signal length verification and appropriate exception throwing

This implementation provides professional-grade digital filtering capabilities for the oscilloscope application, enabling users to enhance signal quality and extract meaningful information from noisy measurements.

# FFTChartProvider.dart Documentation

## Overview

`FFTChartProvider.dart` implements the state management and user interaction logic for the FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) chart component of the oscilloscope application. This provider serves as the bridge between the raw FFT data processing service and the chart visualization, offering a comprehensive set of controls for manipulating the frequency domain view.

## Core Architecture

The file follows the GetX state management pattern, with `FFTChartProvider` extending `GetxController` to provide reactive properties that automatically update the UI when changed. It coordinates with the `FFTChartService` to obtain frequency domain data and manages the visual representation parameters.

## Reactive State Management

The provider maintains several categories of reactive state:

### Display Data

- `fftPoints`: The actual frequency domain data points to display
- `frequency`: The detected fundamental frequency of the signal

### View Control Parameters

- `timeScale`: Horizontal zoom level for the frequency axis (1.0 = full view)
- `valueScale`: Vertical zoom level for the magnitude axis
- `_horizontalOffset`: Panning position along the frequency axis
- `_verticalOffset`: Panning position along the magnitude axis
- `_isPaused`: Whether data acquisition is currently paused

### Reference Values

- `_initialTimeScale` and `_initialValueScale`: Starting scales for zoom operations
- `samplingFrequency` and `nyquistFreq`: Frequency limits derived from device configuration

## Data Flow

The provider establishes a stream subscription to the `FFTChartService`'s data stream in its constructor. When new FFT data is available:

1. The `fftPoints` reactive property is updated with the new data points
2. The `frequency` value is updated with the detected fundamental frequency
3. These updates automatically trigger UI redraws in any widgets observing these values

## Zoom Functionality

The provider implements a sophisticated zooming system for both axes:

### Horizontal (Frequency) Zoom

- `setTimeScale()`: Sets the zoom level with validation and offset clamping
- `zoomX()`: Applies a relative zoom factor to the current scale
- `incrementTimeScale()` / `decrementTimeScale()`: Fine-tune zoom level by fixed increments

### Vertical (Magnitude) Zoom

- `setValueScale()`: Sets the zoom level with validation
- `zoomY()`: Applies a relative zoom factor to the current scale
- `incrementValueScale()` / `decrementValueScale()`: Fine-tune zoom level by fixed increments

### Combined Zooming

- `zoomXY()`: Zooms both axes simultaneously, preserving aspect ratio
- `resetScales()`: Resets all zoom levels to their default values

## Panning Functionality

The provider enables chart panning through several methods:

### Horizontal (Frequency) Panning

- `setHorizontalOffset()`: Sets the view's starting position in the frequency domain
- `_clampHorizontalOffset()`: Ensures the offset remains within valid boundaries
- `incrementHorizontalOffset()` / `decrementHorizontalOffset()`: Shift view by fixed increments

### Vertical (Magnitude) Panning

- `setVerticalOffset()`: Sets the vertical position of the view
- `incrementVerticalOffset()` / `decrementVerticalOffset()`: Shift view by fixed increments

### Panning Reset

- `resetOffsets()`: Returns both offsets to zero, centering the view

## Auto-adjustment Feature

The `autoset()` method provides intelligent view optimization:

1. Calculates a target frequency range to display (10× the fundamental frequency)
2. Determines the appropriate horizontal scale to show this range
3. Centers the view around the detected fundamental frequency
4. Resets the vertical scale to a default value

This feature helps users quickly focus on the most relevant frequency components of the signal without manual adjustment.

## Interactive Controls

The provider supports continuous control adjustments through a timer-based mechanism:

- `startIncrementing()`: Initiates repeated calls to an adjustment function while a control is held
- `stopIncrementing()`: Terminates the continuous adjustment when a control is released

This enables smooth, intuitive interaction with the chart's zoom and pan controls.

## Playback Control

The provider interfaces with the `FFTChartService` to control data acquisition:

- `pause()`: Halts data updates from the FFT service
- `resume()`: Restarts data updates from the FFT service

These methods allow users to freeze the display for detailed analysis or resume live updates as needed.

## Resource Management

The provider properly manages resources by:

- Canceling any active timers in `onClose()`
- Properly nullifying references when operations complete
- Providing consistent state validation in all operations

## Integration with Device Configuration

The provider maintains a reference to the `DeviceConfigProvider` to access critical frequency parameters:

- Sampling frequency (determines the maximum analyzable frequency)
- Nyquist frequency (half the sampling frequency)

These values are essential for correctly scaling the frequency axis and ensuring valid zoom and pan operations.

## Technical Considerations

The implementation includes several technical safeguards:

- Validating scale inputs to prevent invalid zoom levels
- Clamping offsets to prevent viewing outside valid data ranges
- Guarding against division by zero and null values
- Using debug logging in development mode for scale and offset calculations

These measures ensure a robust user experience even with edge-case inputs or unusual signal characteristics.

# OscilloscopeChartProvider Documentation

## Overview

The `OscilloscopeChartProvider` class is a central component in the application's oscilloscope functionality, managing the state and behavior of the time-domain waveform display. Implemented as a GetX controller, it serves as an intermediary between the raw data acquisition system and the UI components that visualize the signal.

## Core Functionality

### State Management

The provider maintains various aspects of the chart's state through reactive variables:

- `_dataPoints`: The waveform data points to be displayed
- `_timeScale` and `_valueScale`: Zoom levels for horizontal and vertical axes
- `_horizontalOffset` and `_verticalOffset`: Panning positions in both dimensions
- `_isPaused`: Whether data acquisition is currently paused

These reactive properties automatically trigger UI updates when their values change, following the GetX reactive programming pattern.

### Data Flow

Upon initialization, the provider subscribes to the `OscilloscopeChartService`'s data stream, which supplies measured waveform points. These points are immediately made available to the chart widget through the `dataPoints` getter.

The initial scales are configured based on the device's ADC range, ensuring appropriate voltage display from the start.

### Coordinate Transformations

A core feature of the provider is its handling of coordinate system transformations:

- `screenToDomainX/Y`: Convert pixel coordinates to time/voltage values
- `domainToScreenX/Y`: Convert time/voltage values to pixel coordinates

These transformations are essential for:

1. Interpreting touch gestures on the chart
2. Positioning UI elements (grids, cursors, etc.)
3. Rendering waveform data points at correct screen positions

The transformations account for the current scale factors and offsets, ensuring consistent display regardless of zoom level or panning position.

### Zoom Management

The provider implements a sophisticated zooming system:

- Multi-touch pinch-to-zoom through the `handleZoom` method
- Programmatic zoom through `incrementTimeScale`, `decrementTimeScale`, etc.
- Scale limits to prevent excessive zoom-out beyond data limits
- Different zoom behaviors based on trigger mode

During zooming, the provider maintains the focal point of the gesture as the center of the zoom operation, providing an intuitive user experience.

### Panning Management

Horizontal and vertical panning is implemented with several constraints:

- In normal trigger mode, horizontal panning is limited to keep data visible
- In single trigger mode, free panning is allowed across the entire time domain
- Small datasets are automatically centered in the view
- Panning offsets are adjusted when zoom levels change

These constraints ensure that users can navigate the signal effectively while maintaining context.

### Trigger Mode Integration

The provider adapts its behavior based on the current trigger mode from the `DataAcquisitionProvider`:

- In normal mode, it limits zooming and panning to keep continuous data visible
- In single mode, it allows more flexible navigation for detailed analysis of captured waveforms

Special methods like `clearForNewTrigger` and `clearAndResume` handle the specific requirements of different trigger modes.

### Auto-scaling

The `autoset` method provides automated signal display optimization:

1. Requests the data acquisition system to adjust its trigger level
2. Retrieves current signal parameters (frequency, max/min values)
3. Calculates optimal scales using the chart service
4. Applies the calculated scales and centers the signal vertically

This feature helps users quickly obtain a clear view of newly acquired signals without manual adjustment.

## Technical Implementation

### User Interaction Support

The provider includes several utility methods that support user interface interactions:

- `startIncrementing`/`stopIncrementing`: Enable continuous adjustment when buttons are held
- `setInitialScales`: Records reference points for zoom operations
- `updateDrawingWidth`: Handles chart resizing

These methods ensure smooth and responsive user interactions with the oscilloscope display.

### Resource Management

Proper resource cleanup is implemented:

- Timers are canceled when no longer needed
- Stream subscriptions are closed in the `onClose` method
- The chart service is disposed when the provider is destroyed

This prevents memory leaks and ensures efficient application performance.

## Integration Points

The provider integrates with several other components:

- `OscilloscopeChartService`: For data acquisition and processing
- `DataAcquisitionProvider`: For trigger mode information and autoset functionality
- `DeviceConfigProvider`: For hardware-specific configuration

This integration allows the oscilloscope chart to operate as part of a cohesive system while maintaining separation of concerns between data acquisition, processing, and visualization.

# UserSettingsProvider Documentation

## Overview

`UserSettingsProvider.dart` implements the central management system for user preferences and display settings in the oscilloscope application. Using the GetX state management pattern, it orchestrates the switching between different visualization modes (time domain oscilloscope and frequency domain spectrum analyzer) and coordinates the related services and UI components.

## Core Architecture

The file defines two key components:

1. **FrequencySource Enumeration**: Defines the possible sources for frequency measurements
2. **UserSettingsProvider Class**: The main controller that manages visualization modes and settings

As a GetX controller, `UserSettingsProvider` integrates with the application's dependency injection system and provides reactive state variables that automatically update the UI when changed.

## State Management

The provider maintains several key pieces of state:

- **mode**: Current visualization mode (oscilloscope or spectrum analyzer)
- **title**: Display title for the current mode
- **frequencySource**: Which measurement method to use for frequency display
- **frequency**: The current measured frequency value

These states are implemented as reactive (`Rx`) variables to enable automatic UI updates when their values change.

## Mode Management

The provider manages two distinct visualization modes:

1. **Oscilloscope Mode**: Time-domain waveform display showing voltage over time
2. **Spectrum Analyzer Mode**: Frequency-domain display showing amplitude over frequency (FFT)

Each mode is represented by a corresponding mode class (`OscilloscopeMode` or `FFTMode`) that encapsulates mode-specific behavior and settings. The provider maintains instances of these modes and delegates to the appropriate one based on the current selection.

## Service Coordination

A key responsibility of the provider is coordinating the underlying services:

- **OscilloscopeChartService**: Manages time-domain data processing
- **FFTChartService**: Manages frequency-domain analysis

When the user switches modes, the provider activates the appropriate service and pauses the inactive one to conserve system resources. This is handled in the `_updateServices()` method, ensuring that only the necessary computations are performed at any time.

## Frequency Measurement

The provider implements a comprehensive frequency measurement system:

1. **Periodic Updates**: A timer periodically updates the displayed frequency value
2. **Multiple Sources**: Frequency can be measured from either time-domain or FFT analysis
3. **Source Selection**: The user can choose which measurement method to use

The `setFrequencySource()` method handles switching between frequency sources and manages the related services accordingly.

## UI Component Management

The provider serves as a bridge between application state and UI components:

1. **Chart Widget Selection**: `getCurrentChart()` returns the appropriate chart widget based on mode
2. **Control Visibility**: Getter methods determine which control panels should be displayed
3. **Navigation**: `navigateToMode()` handles screen transitions with appropriate parameters

This centralized approach ensures consistent UI behavior across the application.

## Mode-Specific Controls

The provider exposes several boolean properties that determine which control panels should be displayed:

- **showTriggerControls**: Whether to show trigger-related controls
- **showTimebaseControls**: Whether to show time base adjustment controls
- **showFFTControls**: Whether to show FFT-specific controls

These properties delegate to the corresponding mode objects, allowing each mode to specify its control requirements.

## Utility Functions

The provider includes utility functions that support various application features:

1. **findMatchingScale()**: Helps match voltage scales between different device configurations
2. **_updateTitle()**: Maintains the correct display title based on the active mode

## Resource Management

The provider implements proper resource handling through:

1. **Timer Management**: Ensures frequency update timer is canceled in `onClose()`
2. **Service Lifecycle**: Activates and deactivates services as needed to optimize performance

## Technical Implementation

### Constants and Defaults

The file defines constants for mode names:

- `osciloscopeMode`: "Oscilloscope"
- `spectrumAnalizerMode`: "Spectrum Analyzer"

These constants are used in the `availableModes` list to maintain consistency throughout the application.

### Constructor Logic

The constructor initializes:

1. Mode instances with their respective services
2. Default mode selection (Oscilloscope)
3. Frequency update timer

This initialization ensures that the application starts with a consistent state and begins monitoring frequency immediately.

### Integration with GetX

The implementation leverages several GetX patterns:

- `Get.find<>()` for dependency injection
- `Get.to()` for navigation
- Reactive variables (`Rx`) for state management
- Controller lifecycle methods (`onClose`)

These patterns enable clean architecture and efficient state management throughout the application.

## Summary

The `UserSettingsProvider` serves as the central coordinator for the oscilloscope application's visualization system, managing modes, coordinating services, and providing appropriate UI components. Its careful resource management and clean architecture enable a responsive and efficient user experience.

# FFTChartService Documentation

## Overview

`FFTChartService.dart` implements a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) signal processing service for the oscilloscope application. This service transforms time-domain waveform data into frequency-domain representations, enabling spectrum analysis functionality. It acts as the computational backbone for the FFT chart display, handling the complex mathematical operations required for frequency analysis.

## Core Architecture

The service operates through a processing pipeline with several distinct stages:

1. **Data Collection**: Accumulates time-domain data points from the data acquisition system
2. **FFT Processing**: Transforms accumulated data into frequency-domain using the FFT algorithm
3. **Frequency Analysis**: Detects significant frequency components in the spectrum
4. **Data Distribution**: Delivers processed frequency-domain data to visualization components

This pipeline is implemented with a reactive streaming architecture, ensuring efficient processing and responsive UI updates.

## Data Flow

### Input Collection

The service subscribes to the `dataPointsStream` from the data acquisition provider and collects incoming data points in a buffer until a full processing block is available. The block size is calculated based on the device's configured samples per packet, ensuring that sufficient data is available for meaningful frequency analysis.

Key components in this stage:

- `_dataBuffer`: A list that accumulates incoming data points
- `blockSize`: The number of points needed for FFT processing (calculated as `samplesPerPacket * 2`)
- `_setupSubscriptions()`: Method that establishes and manages the data stream subscription

### FFT Computation

Once sufficient data is collected, the service performs FFT computation through a series of steps:

1. **Preparation**: Extracts voltage values from data points into separate real and imaginary arrays
2. **Transformation**: Applies the Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm to convert time-domain to frequency-domain
3. **Normalization**: Scales the FFT results by dividing by the number of samples
4. **Conversion**: Transforms the raw FFT output into data points with frequency (Hz) and magnitude (often in dB)

The implementation uses a classic in-place FFT algorithm with bit-reversal permutation and butterfly operations, optimized for performance while maintaining precision.

### Frequency Detection

The service analyzes the FFT output to identify the fundamental frequency of the signal through a peak detection algorithm:

1. Finds the rising edge of the spectrum (where the slope becomes positive)
2. Scans for the highest peak above a minimum threshold
3. Returns the frequency corresponding to that peak, or zero if no significant peak is found

This algorithm is robust against noise and handles cases of weak or absent signals by implementing minimum amplitude and peak height thresholds.

### Output Distribution

Processed FFT data is delivered through a broadcast stream controller that allows multiple UI components to receive updates simultaneously. The service provides:

- `fftStream`: The main output stream of frequency-domain data points
- `frequency`: A getter that calculates and returns the fundamental frequency of the signal

## Key Methods

### Public Interface

- **Constructor**: Initializes the service, sets up subscriptions, and prepares processing parameters
- **`updateProvider()`**: Changes the data source for FFT processing
- **`pause()`**: Temporarily halts FFT processing and clears buffers
- **`resume()`**: Restarts FFT processing after a pause
- **`dispose()`**: Cleans up resources used by the service

### Core Processing

- **`computeFFT()`**: Central method that transforms time-domain data into frequency-domain representation
- **`_fft()`**: Implements the actual Fast Fourier Transform algorithm
- **`_toDecibels()`**: Converts linear magnitude values to logarithmic decibel scale

## Technical Implementation Details

### FFT Algorithm

The service implements the Cooley-Tukey radix-2 decimation-in-time algorithm, which:

1. Performs bit-reversal permutation to reorder input samples
2. Executes successive stages of butterfly operations
3. Combines results to produce the frequency-domain representation

This approach requires the block size to be a power of two for optimal performance, which is ensured by the way the buffer is managed.

### Error Handling

The service implements comprehensive error handling throughout the processing pipeline:

- Input validation to prevent processing invalid data
- Exception handling during FFT computation
- Error propagation through the stream controller
- Graceful degradation when the signal is too weak or noisy

### Resource Management

The service carefully manages system resources:

- Stream subscriptions are properly cancelled when no longer needed
- Buffers are cleared when paused or disposed
- Processing flags prevent concurrent operations on the same data

## Integration with Application Architecture

The FFT chart service integrates with:

1. **Data Acquisition Provider**: Receives time-domain data through its stream
2. **Device Configuration Provider**: Accesses sampling frequency and packet size parameters
3. **FFT Chart Provider**: Delivers processed frequency data for visualization

This integration allows the service to operate efficiently within the application's reactive architecture, providing real-time frequency analysis capabilities to the user interface.

# FFT Algorithm Implementation in FFTChartService

## Overview of the FFT Implementation

The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm in `FFTChartService.dart` transforms time-domain waveform data into a frequency-domain spectrum. This implementation uses the Cooley-Tukey radix-2 decimation-in-time variant, which is optimized for sequences with lengths that are powers of two.

## The FFT Processing Pipeline

The FFT computation follows a structured pipeline:

### 1. Data Preparation

```dart
final n = points.length;
final real = Float32List(n);
final imag = Float32List(n);

// Prepare real and imaginary components for FFT
for (var i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    final value = points[i].y;
    if (value.isInfinite || value.isNaN) {
        throw ArgumentError('Invalid data point at index $i: $value');
    }
    real[i] = value;
    imag[i] = 0.0;
}
```

This stage separates the input signal into real and imaginary components:

- Time-domain data is loaded into the `real` array
- The `imag` array is initialized to zeros (as time-domain signals are purely real)
- Input validation ensures no infinite or NaN values contaminate the computation

### 2. The Core FFT Algorithm

The `_fft` method implements the actual transformation in two phases:

#### Bit-Reversal Permutation

```dart
// Bit reversal permutation
var j = 0;
for (var i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    if (i < j) {
        var tempReal = real[i];
        var tempImag = imag[i];
        real[i] = real[j];
        imag[i] = imag[j];
        real[j] = tempReal;
        imag[j] = tempImag;
    }
    var k = n >> 1;
    while (k <= j) {
        j -= k;
        k >>= 1;
    }
    j += k;
}
```

This first phase reorders the input sequence using bit-reversal permutation:

- The algorithm reorders elements so that the position of each element becomes the bit-reversed value of its original index
- This step prepares the data for the butterfly operations that follow
- The bit manipulation (`>>` for division by 2, etc.) makes this computation efficient

#### Butterfly Operations

```dart
// FFT computation (scalar version)
for (var step = 1; step < n; step <<= 1) {
    final angleStep = -math.pi / step;

    for (var group = 0; group < n; group += step * 2) {
        for (var pair = 0; pair < step; pair++) {
            final angle = angleStep * pair;
            final cosAngle = math.cos(angle);
            final sinAngle = math.sin(angle);

            final evenIndex = group + pair;
            final oddIndex = evenIndex + step;

            final oddReal = real[oddIndex];
            final oddImag = imag[oddIndex];

            final rotatedReal = oddReal * cosAngle - oddImag * sinAngle;
            final rotatedImag = oddReal * sinAngle + oddImag * cosAngle;

            real[oddIndex] = real[evenIndex] - rotatedReal;
            imag[oddIndex] = imag[evenIndex] - rotatedImag;
            real[evenIndex] = real[evenIndex] + rotatedReal;
            imag[evenIndex] = imag[evenIndex] + rotatedImag;
        }
    }
}
```

The second phase applies the FFT through iterative butterfly operations:

1. The algorithm processes the data in increasingly larger steps (`step <<= 1` doubles the step size each iteration)
2. For each step size:
   - An angle step is calculated based on the current FFT stage
   - Data is processed in groups, with each group containing pairs of elements
   - For each pair, a complex multiplication and addition/subtraction creates two new values
3. The nested loop structure:
   - Outer loop: Controls the FFT stage (from small-scale to large-scale transformations)
   - Middle loop: Iterates through groups of data in the current stage
   - Inner loop: Processes pairs within each group

The butterfly operation itself:

- Combines elements that are `step` distance apart
- Uses sine and cosine functions to implement complex multiplication
- Applies the rotation and combination in-place, transforming the arrays as it proceeds

### 3. Normalization

```dart
// Normalize the FFT results
for (var i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (n == 0) throw StateError('Division by zero in normalization');
    real[i] /= n;
    imag[i] /= n;
}
```

After the FFT calculation:

- Values are normalized by dividing by the sequence length `n`
- This scaling ensures consistent magnitude values regardless of input size
- Error checking prevents division by zero (although this should never occur)

### 4. Spectrum Calculation

```dart
final halfLength = (n / 2).ceil();
final samplingRate = deviceConfig.samplingFrequency;
final freqResolution = samplingRate / n;

// Convert the FFT results to DataPoint objects
_lastFFTPoints = List<DataPoint>.generate(halfLength, (i) {
    final re = real[i];
    final im = imag[i];

    if (re.isInfinite || re.isNaN || im.isInfinite || im.isNaN) {
        throw StateError('Invalid FFT result at index $i');
    }

    final magnitude = math.sqrt(re * re + im * im);
    final db = _outputInDb ? _toDecibels(magnitude, maxValue) : magnitude;
    return DataPoint(i * freqResolution, db);
});
```

Finally, the complex FFT results are converted to usable spectrum data:

1. Only the first half of the FFT result is used (due to symmetry in real signals)
2. Frequency resolution is calculated from the sampling rate and FFT size
3. For each frequency bin:
   - Magnitude is calculated using the Pythagorean formula √(re² + im²)
   - Values are optionally converted to decibels for logarithmic display
   - A `DataPoint` is created with frequency (x) and magnitude/decibel value (y)

## Mathematical Foundations

The implementation is based on several mathematical principles:

1. **Divide and Conquer Approach**: The Cooley-Tukey algorithm recursively divides the FFT computation into smaller FFTs, reducing complexity from O(n²) to O(n log n)

2. **Complex Number Operations**: Although not using explicit complex number objects, the code handles complex arithmetic through parallel real and imaginary arrays

3. **Twiddle Factors**: The sine and cosine values (`sinAngle` and `cosAngle`) are the "twiddle factors" that represent the roots of unity in the FFT calculation

4. **Bit Reversal**: The permutation phase exploits the symmetry in the FFT by rearranging data so that the algorithm can work in-place

## Optimizations

The implementation includes several optimizations:

1. **In-place Computation**: The FFT is performed directly in the input arrays, minimizing memory usage

2. **Float32List**: Using typed arrays (`Float32List`) improves performance compared to regular Dart lists

3. **Bit Manipulation**: Bitwise operations (`<<`, `>>`) are used for efficient power-of-two calculations

4. **Error Prevention**: Comprehensive validation prevents unstable calculations from producing invalid results

5. **Logarithmic Scaling**: Optional conversion to decibels provides better visualization of signals with wide dynamic range

This FFT implementation provides an efficient and numerically stable method for transforming time-domain oscilloscope data into the frequency domain, enabling spectrum analysis features in the application.

# OscilloscopeChartService Documentation

## Overview

`OscilloscopeChartService.dart` implements a service layer that acts as an intermediary between raw data acquisition and the oscilloscope chart display. Implementing the `OscilloscopeChartRepository` interface, this service processes time-domain waveform data and manages the state of the oscilloscope display, particularly focusing on trigger handling and data flow control.

## Repository Pattern Implementation

The class implements the `OscilloscopeChartRepository` interface, following the repository pattern which provides an abstraction layer for data operations. This design allows the application to:

1. Separate business logic from data access mechanisms
2. Maintain a consistent interface even if the underlying data source changes
3. Facilitate testing through dependency injection

The implementation meets all the interface requirements while adding specific processing for oscilloscope functionality.

## Core Components

### Data Source Management

The service maintains a reference to a `DataAcquisitionProvider` which serves as the primary source of time-domain data. This provider connection can be updated at runtime through the `updateProvider()` method, allowing dynamic reconfiguration of the data source.

### Data Streaming Architecture

The service implements a reactive streaming architecture with:

1. **Stream Controller**: A broadcast `_dataController` that allows multiple listeners to receive data
2. **Stream Subscription**: A subscription to the data acquisition provider's stream
3. **State Management**: A `_isPaused` flag that controls data flow

This architecture enables real-time data visualization while maintaining control over the flow of data.

## Data Processing Pipeline

The service processes data through a well-defined pipeline:

### 1. Data Reception

Data points are received from the `DataAcquisitionProvider` through the subscription established in `_setupSubscriptions()`. This subscription listens to the provider's data stream and processes each batch of points according to the current trigger mode and pause state.

### 2. Trigger Handling

The service implements specialized handling for different trigger modes:

- In **Single Trigger Mode**: When a trigger event is detected (a data point with `isTrigger = true`), the service emits the data points and then automatically pauses to freeze the display on the triggered waveform.
- In **Normal Mode**: Data points flow continuously to the chart as long as the service is not paused.

This behavior matches traditional oscilloscope functionality, where single trigger mode captures one waveform and then stops, while normal mode continuously updates.

### 3. Data Distribution

Processed data points are broadcast through the `dataStream` getter, which provides a public interface for UI components to receive time-domain waveform data. The broadcast nature of this stream allows multiple chart widgets or other components to display the same data simultaneously.

## Autoset Functionality

The `calculateAutosetScales()` method implements a sophisticated algorithm to automatically configure chart display settings based on signal characteristics:

1. **Amplitude Scaling**: Calculates appropriate vertical scale based on signal minimum and maximum values
2. **Time Scaling**: Determines horizontal scale to display approximately three periods of the detected frequency
3. **Vertical Centering**: Computes the vertical center point for the display
4. **Margin Handling**: Applies a margin factor to ensure the signal doesn't touch the edges of the display

This functionality mirrors the "autoset" button found on physical oscilloscopes, which automatically adjusts settings to optimally display the current signal.

## State Management

The service manages several aspects of display state:

1. **Pause State**: Tracks whether data flow is currently paused through the `_isPaused` flag
2. **Resource Management**: Properly handles stream subscriptions and controllers to prevent memory leaks
3. **Configuration Parameters**: Provides access to key parameters like sample distance through getter methods

## Technical Details

### Sample Distance Calculation

The `distance` getter calculates the time interval between consecutive samples based on the current sampling frequency from the device configuration. This value is essential for proper time-domain display and measurements.

### Error Handling

The service implements defensive programming by:

1. Checking for null provider references before attempting to access them
2. Handling edge cases in the autoset calculation (zero frequency, zero range, etc.)
3. Properly managing resources through explicit disposal

### Configuration Integration

The service integrates with `DeviceConfigProvider` to access device-specific parameters needed for proper waveform scaling and display.

## Summary

The `OscilloscopeChartService` provides a crucial intermediary layer that processes raw oscilloscope data and manages the state of the time-domain display. By implementing the repository pattern, it ensures a clean separation between data acquisition and visualization while providing specialized functionality for oscilloscope operation, including trigger handling, pausable data flow, and automatic display scaling.

# GraphScreen.dart Documentation

## Overview

`GraphScreen.dart` implements the main visualization screen of the oscilloscope application, providing a flexible display area for either time-domain (oscilloscope) or frequency-domain (FFT) waveforms. This screen serves as the central user interface for signal visualization and control, adapting its display and functionality based on the selected graph mode.

## Architecture

The file implements a stateless widget that follows several important Flutter and application architecture patterns:

1. **Dependency Injection**: Uses GetX dependency injection to access providers and services
2. **Factory Constructor Pattern**: Employs a private constructor with a public factory method for controlled instance creation
3. **Responsive Design**: Adapts the UI layout based on available space
4. **Reactive UI**: Uses Obx for reactive UI updates when underlying data changes

## Component Structure

### Screen Layout

The screen is organized into a horizontal layout with two main sections:

1. **Chart Display Area**: An expandable section that shows either:
   - Oscilloscope chart (time-domain waveform)
   - FFT chart (frequency spectrum)

2. **Control Panel**: A fixed-width (170px) sidebar containing user settings and controls relevant to the selected mode

### AppBar Configuration

The screen features a compact AppBar (25px height) that includes:

- A reactive title that updates based on the selected mode
- A back navigation button with custom positioning (-5px vertical offset)
- Theme-consistent colors for text and icons

## Initialization Process

The screen implements a sophisticated initialization flow through its factory constructor:

1. **Provider Resolution**: Retrieves necessary provider instances using GetX dependency resolution
2. **Controller Setup**: Creates and registers a TextEditingController for trigger level input
3. **Mode Configuration**: Sets the user settings provider to the specified graph mode
4. **Deferred Autoset**: Schedules post-frame callbacks for automatic scaling:
   - For oscilloscope mode: Configures time and voltage scales based on signal characteristics
   - For spectrum analyzer mode: Configures frequency and amplitude scales based on detected frequency

This initialization approach ensures the screen is correctly configured before the first render cycle, while deferring expensive operations until after the UI is ready.

## Mode-Specific Behavior

The screen adapts to the selected graph mode in several ways:

### Oscilloscope Mode

When in oscilloscope mode, the screen:

- Displays time-domain waveforms
- Shows relevant oscilloscope controls (trigger, timebase, etc.)
- Automatically scales to show meaningful time and voltage ranges

### Spectrum Analyzer Mode

When in spectrum analyzer mode, the screen:

- Displays frequency-domain spectrum (FFT)
- Shows relevant FFT controls
- Automatically scales to focus on significant frequency components

## Dynamic Content

The screen implements reactive content that updates automatically when the underlying data changes:

1. **Empty State Handling**: Shows a loading indicator when no data points are available
2. **Dynamic Chart Selection**: Switches between chart types based on the current mode
3. **Reactive Title**: Updates the AppBar title to reflect the current mode

## Data Flow

The screen orchestrates a complex data flow between multiple components:

1. **Data Source**: The DataAcquisitionProvider supplies raw waveform data
2. **Processing**: Data is processed by either OscilloscopeChartProvider or FFTChartProvider
3. **Visualization**: The UserSettingsProvider supplies the appropriate chart widget
4. **User Input**: Control inputs are passed back to the providers for processing

This bidirectional flow enables real-time interaction with the visualization system.

## Theme Integration

The screen integrates with the application's theming system in several ways:

1. **Background Colors**: Uses the scaffold background color for consistent appearance
2. **Text Colors**: Adapts text colors based on the current theme
3. **Icon Colors**: Uses theme-aware icon coloring

This approach ensures visual consistency across different theme configurations (light/dark modes).

## Technical Details

### Controller Lifecycle Management

The screen registers the TextEditingController with GetX to ensure proper disposal, preventing memory leaks when the screen is removed from the navigation stack.

### Layout Optimization

The screen uses several layout optimizations:

- FittedBox with scaleDown fit policy for flexible title sizing
- Fixed-width sidebar to ensure consistent control layout
- Expanded widget for adaptable chart area sizing

These optimizations ensure the screen functions properly across different device sizes and orientations.

### Error Prevention

The screen employs several techniques to prevent errors:

- Null safety throughout the implementation
- Reactive observers that handle empty data states
- Consistent theme application to prevent visual artifacts

These measures contribute to a robust user experience even under variable conditions.

# ModeSelectionScreen.dart Documentation

## Overview

`ModeSelectionScreen.dart` implements a mode selection interface that serves as a gateway between the setup process and the visualization screens of the oscilloscope application. This screen allows users to choose between different visualization modes (Oscilloscope or FFT/Spectrum Analyzer) before entering the main graph display.

## Core Architecture

The file implements a stateful widget with lifecycle management capabilities to ensure proper resource handling during navigation. The screen follows a clean, focused design with a single responsibility: enabling mode selection for the oscilloscope application.

## Widget Structure

### Widget Hierarchy

- `ModeSelectionScreen` (StatefulWidget)
  - Creates `_ModeSelectionScreenState` as its state object

- `_ModeSelectionScreenState` (State)
  - Implements the UI and lifecycle management
  - Mixes in `WidgetsBindingObserver` to handle system events (though currently not actively using those callbacks)

### UI Components

The screen's UI consists of:

1. **AppBar**: Contains the screen title ("Select Mode") and a back button for navigation to the Setup screen
2. **Instruction Text**: Provides clear direction to the user about the purpose of the screen
3. **Mode Selection Buttons**: Dynamically generated buttons for each available mode (Oscilloscope and Spectrum Analyzer)
4. **Scrollable Container**: Enables the interface to adapt to different screen sizes and orientations

## Data Flow and State Management

The screen integrates with the application's state management architecture through:

1. **GetX Dependency Injection**: Retrieves necessary provider instances:
   - `DataAcquisitionProvider`: For controlling data acquisition
   - `UserSettingsProvider`: For accessing available modes and handling navigation
   - `SetupProvider`: For resetting state during backward navigation

2. **Provider-UI Integration**: The UI dynamically reflects the available modes exposed by the UserSettingsProvider

## Lifecycle Management

The screen implements careful lifecycle management to ensure proper resource handling:

### Initialization

In `initState()`:

- Registers as a WidgetsBindingObserver (though currently not using the callbacks)

### Disposal

In `dispose()`:

- Unregisters as a WidgetsBindingObserver
- Stops data acquisition to prevent resource leaks and unnecessary background processing
- Logs disposal actions in debug mode

## Navigation Management

The screen implements sophisticated navigation handling:

### Forward Navigation

When a mode is selected:

- Delegates to `UserSettingsProvider.navigateToMode()` to:
  - Set the chosen mode in the user settings
  - Navigate to the GraphScreen with the selected mode
  - Configure the appropriate chart display (Oscilloscope or FFT)

### Backward Navigation

The `_navigateBackToSetup()` method implements a robust backward navigation process:

1. Stops ongoing data acquisition to prevent resource leaks
2. Resets setup state to ensure a clean restart of the setup flow
3. Handles potential errors during cleanup
4. Uses `Get.offAll()` to clear the navigation stack and prevent accumulation of screens
5. Returns to the SetupScreen as a fresh start

## UI Design Features

The screen incorporates several design considerations:

1. **Safety**: Uses `SafeArea` to avoid intrusion into system UI areas
2. **Scrollability**: Implements `SingleChildScrollView` to accommodate various device sizes
3. **Consistent Spacing**: Uses standardized padding values for visual harmony
4. **Visual Hierarchy**: Employs clear typographic hierarchy with title styles
5. **Button Design**: Configures buttons with appropriate sizing, shaping, and typography

## Performance Considerations

The screen implements performance best practices:

1. **Minimal State**: Maintains only the essential state needed for functionality
2. **Lazy Evaluation**: Uses `.map()` for dynamic button generation rather than precreating all elements
3. **Resource Cleanup**: Ensures all resources are properly released during disposal

## Error Handling

The screen implements error handling in critical areas:

1. **Navigation Safety**: Wraps state reset operations in try-catch to prevent navigation failures
2. **Logging**: Provides debug logging for errors and important state changes
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Ensures navigation works even if state reset fails

## Connection to Application Flow

This screen serves as an important junction in the application's overall flow:

1. **Entry Point**: Usually reached after completing the setup process
2. **Decision Point**: Where users select how they want to visualize their signals
3. **Exit Points**: Either back to Setup or forward to the Graph screen with a selected mode

This strategic position makes the ModeSelectionScreen a critical interface element for guiding users through the oscilloscope application's workflow.

# FFTChart.dart Documentation

## Overview

`FFTChart.dart` implements the graphical visualization component of the spectrum analyzer functionality within the oscilloscope application. This file provides a complete user interface for displaying frequency-domain data obtained through Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis, along with controls for manipulating the view and interacting with the data. It serves as the visual representation layer for frequency analysis, allowing users to examine signal components in the frequency domain.

## Component Hierarchy

The file implements a hierarchical component structure that separates concerns:

1. **Main Container (`FFTChart`)**: The top-level component that orchestrates the overall layout
2. **Chart Area (`_ChartArea`)**: The visualization space where frequency data is displayed
3. **Gesture Handler (`_ChartGestureHandler`)**: Processes user interactions like zooming and panning
4. **Chart Painter (`_ChartPainter`)**: Renders the actual frequency data using a custom painter
5. **Control Panel (`_ControlPanel`)**: Contains interactive controls for manipulating the display
6. **Specialized Controls**: Various button components for specific control functions

This structure facilitates separation of concerns, allowing each component to focus on a specific aspect of the chart's functionality.

## Chart Visualization

The core visualization is implemented through the `FFTChartPainter` class, a custom painter that renders:

1. **Background**: A solid background area for the chart
2. **Grid Lines**: Horizontal and vertical reference lines at regular intervals
3. **Axis Labels**: Frequency (Hz) labels on the x-axis and amplitude (dBV) labels on the y-axis
4. **Data Plot**: The actual frequency spectrum represented as a connected line plot
5. **Border**: A frame around the chart area for visual clarity

The painter implements a sophisticated coordinate transformation system that maps between:

- **Domain Space**: The actual frequency and amplitude values
- **View Space**: The visible portion of the frequency spectrum based on scale and offset
- **Screen Space**: The pixel coordinates on the display

## User Interaction Model

The file implements a comprehensive interaction model through `_ChartGestureHandler`:

### Zooming Mechanisms

1. **Mouse Wheel Zooming**:
   - Standard scroll: Zooms both axes simultaneously
   - Ctrl+scroll: Zooms only the frequency axis
   - Shift+scroll: Zooms only the amplitude axis

2. **Touch Gestures**:
   - Pinch-to-zoom (handled by the provider)
   - Single-finger drag for panning

### Panning Controls

The chart supports panning through:

- Touch drag gestures (handled in `_handleScaleUpdate`)
- Button controls in the control panel (handled by `_OffsetControls`)

Each pan operation updates the appropriate offset value (horizontal or vertical) in the provider, which then triggers a redraw of the chart.

## Control Interface

The control panel provides several interaction components:

1. **Play/Pause Button**: Toggles data acquisition to freeze or resume the FFT display
2. **Scale Buttons**: Controls for adjusting both horizontal (frequency) and vertical (amplitude) scales
3. **Autoset Button**: Automatically configures optimal view settings based on detected frequency
4. **Offset Controls**: Directional buttons for precise panning in all directions

These controls are arranged in a horizontal, scrollable toolbar at the bottom of the chart for easy access.

## Data Flow Architecture

The file follows a unidirectional data flow pattern:

1. **Data Source**: FFT data comes from the `FFTChartProvider`
2. **State Management**: GetX reactive variables (`Obx`) are used to automatically update UI when data changes
3. **Rendering**: The custom painter transforms data into visual output
4. **User Input**: Control actions are dispatched back to the provider

This architecture ensures that all components stay synchronized with the current application state.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Responsive Sizing

The chart implements responsive sizing through:

- `LayoutBuilder` to adapt to available space
- Flexible layout using `Expanded` widgets
- Dynamic calculation of chart dimensions based on constraints

### Coordinate Transformations

The painter implements sophisticated transformations to handle:

- Frequency domain scaling (`timeScale`)
- Amplitude scaling (`valueScale`)
- Horizontal panning (`horizontalOffset`)
- Vertical panning (`verticalOffset`)

These transformations enable viewing different portions of the spectrum at different detail levels.

### Performance Optimizations

Several performance optimizations are implemented:

1. **Clipping**: The canvas is clipped to the chart area to avoid unnecessary rendering
2. **Path-based Drawing**: FFT data is rendered as a single path rather than individual lines
3. **Conditional Rendering**: Grid lines and labels are only drawn if they fall within the visible area
4. **Efficient Repainting**: The `shouldRepaint` method prevents unnecessary redraws

These optimizations ensure smooth performance even with large FFT datasets.

### Theme Integration

The chart integrates with the application's theme system through:

- `AppTheme` utility methods to access appropriate colors for different chart elements
- Context-aware styling that adapts to light and dark themes
- Consistent visual styling across chart components

## Interaction with Application Architecture

The `FFTChart` relies on several other components in the application architecture:

1. **FFTChartProvider**: Supplies the FFT data and handles view state management
2. **DataAcquisitionProvider**: Provides fallback frequency values for autoset functionality
3. **UnitFormat**: Formats frequency and amplitude values with appropriate units
4. **AppTheme**: Provides consistent visual styling across the application

This integration enables the chart to function as part of the larger application ecosystem while maintaining separation of concerns.

# OscilloscopeChart.dart Documentation

## Overview

`OscilloscopeChart.dart` implements the time-domain waveform visualization component of the oscilloscope application. This file provides a comprehensive UI for displaying real-time voltage measurements against time, along with interactive controls for manipulating the view. It serves as the primary visual interface for signal analysis in the time domain, enabling users to examine voltage waveforms with traditional oscilloscope functionality.

## Component Architecture

The file employs a modular architecture that divides responsibilities among specialized components:

1. **Main Container (`OsciloscopeChart`)**: Orchestrates the overall chart layout, integrating dependencies via GetX
2. **Chart Area (`_ChartArea`)**: Provides the visualization space for waveform display
3. **Gesture Handler (`_ChartGestureHandler`)**: Manages user interactions like zooming and panning
4. **Chart Painter (`_ChartPainter`)**: Renders the custom chart visualization using a `CustomPaint` widget
5. **Control Panel (`_ControlPanel`)**: Contains interactive controls for manipulating the display
6. **UI Controls**: Various button components for specific functions (play/pause, zoom, pan, etc.)

This hierarchical organization ensures separation of concerns and maintainability while supporting a complex set of visualization features.

## Core Visualization: OscilloscopeChartPainter

The heart of the visualization is the `OscilloscopeChartPainter` class, a custom painter that handles the actual drawing of the oscilloscope display. This component implements:

### Chart Layout

The painter establishes a structured layout with distinct areas:

- Chart background with proper margins
- Y-axis area on the left for voltage indicators
- X-axis area at the bottom for time indicators
- Main plotting area for waveform visualization

Constants `_offsetX`, `_offsetY`, and `_sqrOffsetBot` define these margins, creating the classic oscilloscope display layout.

### Coordinate System Transformation

The painter implements bidirectional transformations between three coordinate spaces:

1. **Domain Space**: Raw time and voltage values from measurements
2. **Chart Space**: Normalized positions accounting for scaling and offsets
3. **Screen Space**: Pixel coordinates on the display

Key transformation methods include:

- `_domainToScreenX/Y`: Map time/voltage values to pixel coordinates
- `_screenToDomainX`: Map pixel positions to time values

These transformations handle the complexity of zooming, panning, and appropriate scaling for visualization.

### Grid and Axes

The oscilloscope display features a comprehensive grid system:

- Horizontal grid lines for voltage reference (`_drawYAxisGridAndLabels`)
- Vertical grid lines for time reference (`_drawXAxisGridAndLabels`)
- Automatic spacing calculation to maintain readable intervals
- Formatted labels with appropriate units (volts and seconds)
- Zero-reference line highlighted for easy identification

The grid spacing dynamically adjusts based on the current zoom level, ensuring that grid lines remain usable and informative regardless of scale.

### Waveform Rendering

The painter plots the actual waveform data with several optimizations:

- Line segments between consecutive data points
- Efficient clipping of lines to the visible area (`_clipPoint`)
- Visibility testing to avoid unnecessary drawing (`_isLineVisible`)
- Handling of edge cases (NaN, infinite values, etc.)
- Styled rendering with appropriate color and line thickness

The implementation uses a segment-by-segment approach rather than a full path, which enables precise control over which portions of the waveform are rendered.

### Line Clipping Algorithm

The painter implements a simplified Cohen-Sutherland line clipping approach to handle cases where waveform lines extend beyond the visible chart area:

1. First determines if a line segment is potentially visible
2. For visible segments, clips each endpoint to the chart boundaries
3. Handles special cases like vertical lines and NaN values
4. Ensures all rendered lines remain within the chart's boundaries

This clipping approach ensures visual correctness while maintaining rendering performance.

## User Interaction Model

The file implements a comprehensive interaction system through the `_ChartGestureHandler` class:

### Zooming Mechanisms

1. **Mouse Wheel Zoom**:
   - Standard scroll: Zooms both axes proportionally
   - Ctrl+scroll: Zooms only the time axis (horizontal)
   - Shift+scroll: Zooms only the voltage axis (vertical)

2. **Touch Gestures**:
   - Two-finger pinch for zooming with focal point preservation
   - Single-finger drag for panning

The zoom implementation maintains proper scaling constraints and updates the drawing width to ensure correct behavior at various zoom levels.

### Panning Controls

Panning is implemented through two complementary methods:

1. **Direct gesture**: Dragging with one finger/pointer
2. **Control buttons**: Arrow buttons in the control panel for fine adjustments

Each pan operation updates the appropriate offset (horizontal or vertical) and recalculates valid ranges to maintain proper view constraints.

## Control Interface

The control panel (`_ControlPanel`) provides a comprehensive set of controls:

1. **Play/Pause**: Toggles data acquisition to freeze or resume the waveform display
2. **Scale Buttons**: Controls for adjusting time and voltage scales
3. **Autoset Button**: Automatically configures optimal time and voltage scales
4. **Navigation Controls**: Directional buttons for precise panning

These controls are organized into two logical groups:

- `_MainControls`: Primary functions for controlling the signal display
- `_OffsetControls`: Navigation buttons for adjusting the view position

## Widget Integration and Data Flow

The chart integrates with the application's state management using the GetX pattern:

1. **Data Acquisition**: Waveform data comes from the `OscilloscopeChartProvider`
2. **Reactive Updates**: Observes data changes using `Obx` for automatic UI updates
3. **Configuration Access**: Retrieves device configuration from `DeviceConfigProvider`
4. **Action Dispatch**: User interactions trigger actions on the providers

This reactive approach ensures the chart remains synchronized with the current application state.

## Control Button Implementation

The file implements a standardized button interaction model through the `_ControlButton` class:

1. **Immediate Action**: Button taps trigger immediate execution of the associated action
2. **Long Press Handling**: Long presses initiate continuous action execution
3. **Consistent Styling**: Maintains visual consistency across all control buttons

This approach enables both precise single adjustments and continuous adjustments when needed.

## Visual Theming

The chart integrates with the application's theming system through various mechanisms:

1. **Theme-Aware Paints**: Initializes drawing colors based on the current theme
2. **AppTheme Integration**: Uses utility methods to access appropriate colors
3. **Context-Based Styling**: Adapts text and line colors to the current theme
4. **Dynamic Paint Creation**: Reinitializes paints when the theme context changes

This approach ensures the oscilloscope display maintains visual consistency with the rest of the application.

## Performance Considerations

The implementation includes several performance optimizations:

1. **Efficient Clipping**: Avoids unnecessary rendering of off-screen content
2. **Visibility Testing**: Skips drawing of completely invisible line segments
3. **Paint Reuse**: Initializes paint objects once for repeated use
4. **Validation Checks**: Guards against rendering invalid data points
5. **Layout Caching**: Stores calculated layout dimensions for consistent use

These optimizations ensure smooth performance even with high-frequency waveform data or rapid updates.

# Initializer.dart Documentation

## Overview

`Initializer.dart` serves as the dependency initialization system for the oscilloscope application, providing a centralized mechanism for configuring, instantiating, and registering all service and provider components. This file plays a critical role in establishing the application architecture by implementing a systematic initialization process that ensures proper dependency resolution and service availability throughout the application lifecycle.

## Core Functionality

The `Initializer` class provides a single static method, `init()`, that orchestrates the entire initialization process. This method is called during application startup (from

main.dart

) before the first UI components are rendered, ensuring that all required services and providers are ready when the application begins execution.

## Initialization Architecture

The initialization process follows a carefully structured sequence that respects dependency relationships:

### 1. Flutter Binding Initialization

The process begins by calling `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()`, which initializes the Flutter engine's bindings. This step is necessary for any Flutter application that performs initialization before calling `runApp()`.

### 2. Configuration Objects Setup

The initializer creates and registers fundamental configuration objects that don't depend on other components:

- `HttpConfig`: Contains base URL configuration for HTTP communication (`http://192.168.4.1:81`)
- `SocketConnection`: Contains network parameters for WebSocket communication (`192.168.4.1:8080`)
- `DeviceConfigProvider`: Manages device-specific configuration parameters

These configurations are registered as permanent singletons in the GetX dependency injection system, making them accessible throughout the application.

### 3. Service Layer Initialization

With configuration objects in place, the initializer proceeds to create service layer components:

- `HttpService`: Handles HTTP communication using the `HttpConfig`
- `DataAcquisitionService`: Manages data acquisition operations using the `HttpConfig`
- `OscilloscopeChartService`: Processes time-domain signal data
- `FFTChartService`: Processes frequency-domain signal data
- `SetupService`: Handles device setup and configuration

The `DataAcquisitionService` undergoes an additional initialization step through its `initialize()` method, which likely sets up internal state or performs initial communication with the hardware.

### 4. Provider Layer Configuration

After services are initialized, provider components that depend on these services are created and registered:

- `UserSettingsProvider`: Manages user preferences and settings
- `DataAcquisitionProvider`: Coordinates data acquisition operations
- `OscilloscopeChartProvider`: Manages oscilloscope chart state and operations
- `FFTChartProvider`: Manages FFT chart state and operations
- `SetupProvider`: Manages setup workflow state

These providers form the application's state management layer, bridging between services and UI components.

### 5. Cross-Component Integration

The initializer performs essential cross-component integration to establish proper communication channels:

```dart
oscilloscopeChartService.updateProvider(dataAcquisitionProvider);
fftChartService.updateProvider(dataAcquisitionProvider);
```

This step connects the chart services to their data source, enabling them to receive real-time measurement data.

## Dependency Management Approach

The file uses GetX's dependency injection system for managing application dependencies:

### Singleton Registration

Each dependency is registered using `Get.put()` with the `permanent: true` flag for most components, ensuring they remain in memory throughout the application's lifecycle:

```dart
Get.put<DeviceConfigProvider>(deviceConfigProvider, permanent: true);
```

### Type-Safe Registration

Dependencies are registered with explicit type parameters to enable type-safe resolution later:

```dart
Get.put<HttpService>(httpService, permanent: true);
```

### Dependency Access

Dependencies can be accessed later in the application using `Get.find()`:

```dart
oscilloscopeService: Get.find<OscilloscopeChartService>()
```

## Error Handling

The initialization process includes comprehensive error handling to prevent application crashes during startup:

```dart
try {
  // Initialization code
} catch (e) {
  if (kDebugMode) {
    print('Error during initialization: $e');
  }
  rethrow;
}
```

This approach provides debugging information in development mode while ensuring that any initialization errors are properly propagated to the calling context.

## Component Dependencies

The initialization sequence reveals the dependency structure of the application:

1. **Base Dependencies**:
   - `HttpConfig`
   - `SocketConnection`
   - `DeviceConfigProvider`

2. **Service Layer**:
   - `HttpService` ← `HttpConfig`
   - `DataAcquisitionService` ← `HttpConfig`
   - `OscilloscopeChartService` ← (initially null, later `DataAcquisitionProvider`)
   - `FFTChartService` ← (initially null, later `DataAcquisitionProvider`)
   - `SetupService` ← `SocketConnection`, `HttpConfig`

3. **Provider Layer**:
   - `UserSettingsProvider` ← `OscilloscopeChartService`, `FFTChartService`
   - `DataAcquisitionProvider` ← `DataAcquisitionService`, `SocketConnection`
   - `OscilloscopeChartProvider` ← `OscilloscopeChartService`
   - `FFTChartProvider` ← `FFTChartService`
   - `SetupProvider` ← `SetupService`

This hierarchy ensures that each component has access to its required dependencies when initialized.

## Integration with Application Architecture

Within the broader application architecture, `Initializer.dart` serves several critical functions:

1. **Dependency Provision**: Ensures all components can access their dependencies through GetX's injection system
2. **Configuration Management**: Centralizes configuration values for network communication
3. **Startup Orchestration**: Establishes the correct initialization order for interdependent components
4. **Application Lifecycle Management**: Creates permanent instances that persist throughout the application's lifespan

By centralizing these responsibilities, the initializer promotes clean architecture principles by separating configuration concerns from business logic and UI components.

# AppTheme.dart Documentation

## Overview

`AppTheme.dart` implements the visual design system for the oscilloscope application, providing a comprehensive theming solution that supports both light and dark modes. This file centralizes all theme-related configuration, ensuring visual consistency across the application while enabling dynamic theme switching and context-aware styling.

## Core Components

The file defines several key components that collectively establish the application's visual identity:

### 1. Theme Definitions

Two complete `ThemeData` instances are defined:

- `lightTheme`: A bright theme with blue accent colors and predominantly white backgrounds
- `darkTheme`: A dark theme with blue accents and black backgrounds

Each theme defines a comprehensive set of properties including:

- Color scheme (primary, secondary, and accent colors)
- Text styles for various typography elements
- AppBar styling configuration
- Button styling
- Icon color definitions
- Background colors

### 2. Context-Aware Styling Methods

The file provides numerous static methods that return theme-appropriate styling elements based on the current context:

- `getDataPaint`: Returns a paint style for waveform data (yellow in dark mode, blue in light mode)
- `getZeroPaint`: Returns a paint style for the zero-voltage reference line
- `getBorderPaint`: Returns a paint style for chart borders
- `getChartBackgroundPaint`: Returns a paint style for chart backgrounds
- `getFFTDataPaint`: Returns a paint style for FFT data visualization

These methods examine the current theme context (light or dark) and return appropriately styled visual elements.

### 3. Color Accessors

Simple accessors provide theme-appropriate colors for various UI elements:

- `getAppBarTextColor`: For AppBar text
- `getChartAreaColor`: For chart container backgrounds
- `getTextColor`: For general text elements
- `getIconColor`: For icons
- `getControlPanelColor`: For control panel backgrounds
- `getLoadingIndicatorColor`: For progress indicators
- `getFFTBackgroundColor`: For FFT chart backgrounds

These accessors ensure that individual components can get the correct color for the current theme without duplicating theme-switching logic.

## Implementation Details

### Theme Configuration

Both light and dark themes are configured with consistent properties to ensure appropriate contrast and readability:

#### Light Theme

```dart
static ThemeData lightTheme = ThemeData(
  brightness: Brightness.light,
  primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
  scaffoldBackgroundColor: const Color.fromARGB(255, 255, 255, 255),
  // Additional properties...
)
```

#### Dark Theme

```dart
static ThemeData darkTheme = ThemeData(
  brightness: Brightness.dark,
  primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
  scaffoldBackgroundColor: Colors.black,
  // Additional properties...
)
```

Each theme maintains a consistent color identity while adapting contrast levels to ensure readability in different lighting conditions.

### Context-Aware Styling

The context-aware styling methods follow a consistent pattern:

1. Examine the current context to determine if dark mode is active
2. Return an appropriately configured styling object

For example:

```dart
static Paint getDataPaint(BuildContext context) {
  final isDark = Theme.of(context).brightness == Brightness.dark;
  return Paint()
    ..color = isDark ? Colors.yellow : Colors.blue
    ..strokeWidth = 2;
}
```

This approach enables components to adapt their appearance to the current theme without maintaining duplicate styling logic.

### Paint vs. Color Providers

The file implements two categories of styling providers:

1. **Paint Providers**: Return complete `Paint` objects configured with color, stroke width, and style
2. **Color Providers**: Return simple `Color` objects for direct use

This distinction accommodates different requirements across the UI - complex drawing operations requiring `Paint` objects and simple styling requiring only colors.

## Integration with Application Architecture

Within the application architecture, `AppTheme.dart` serves as a central visual design system that:

1. **Provides Theme Data**: Supplies complete theme configurations to the `GetMaterialApp` in

main.dart

2. **Supports Chart Visualization**: Provides specialized painting styles to the oscilloscope and FFT chart components
3. **Ensures Consistency**: Centralizes theme definitions to maintain visual coherence throughout the application
4. **Enables Adaptation**: Allows the application to seamlessly switch between light and dark modes without component changes

By centralizing theme definitions, the file ensures that all components share a consistent visual language while remaining adaptable to different theme configurations.

# Main.dart Documentation

## Overview

main.dart

 serves as the entry point for the oscilloscope application, handling initial setup, configuration, and UI bootstrapping. This file orchestrates the application's startup sequence, including dependency initialization, permission requests, orientation configuration, and theme application.

## Core Functions

The file implements several key functions that establish the application environment:

### 1. Application Entry Point

The `main()` function serves as the primary entry point, orchestrating the startup sequence:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await SystemChrome.setPreferredOrientations([...]);
  if (Platform.isAndroid) {
    await requestPermissions();
  }
  await Initializer.init();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

This sequence ensures that all necessary configurations and initializations occur before the UI is rendered.

### 2. Permission Management

The `requestPermissions()` function handles requesting necessary runtime permissions on Android devices:

```dart
Future<void> requestPermissions() async {
  await [
    Permission.locationAlways,
    Permission.nearbyWifiDevices,
    Permission.location,
  ].request();
}
```

These permissions are essential for WiFi and network functionality used by the application to communicate with oscilloscope hardware.

### 3. Application Root Widget

The `MyApp` class defines the root widget of the application, configuring the GetX navigation system and applying the theming:

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return GetMaterialApp(
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      title: 'ARG_OSCI',
      theme: AppTheme.lightTheme,
      darkTheme: AppTheme.darkTheme,
      themeMode: ThemeMode.light,
      home: SetupScreen(),
      getPages: [...],
    );
  }
}
```

This configuration establishes the application's visual identity and navigation structure.

## Initialization Process

The application startup follows a deliberate sequence:

1. **Flutter Binding Initialization**: `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` initializes Flutter engine bindings
2. **Orientation Lock**: Forces the application into landscape orientation, which is optimal for oscilloscope visualization
3. **Permission Request**: On Android devices, requests necessary permissions for network and location functionality
4. **Dependency Initialization**: Calls `Initializer.init()` to set up all application services and providers
5. **UI Rendering**: Calls `runApp()` with the root `MyApp` widget to begin UI rendering

This sequence ensures that all prerequisites are satisfied before the application UI is displayed.

## Navigation Configuration

The file configures the GetX navigation system with defined routes:

```dart
getPages: [
  GetPage(name: '/', page: () => SetupScreen()),
  GetPage(name: '/mode_selection', page: () => ModeSelectionScreen()),
  GetPage(name: '/graph', page: () => GraphScreen(graphMode: 'Oscilloscope')),
],
```

These routes define the application's main navigation paths:

1. Root path (`/`): Initial setup screen
2. Mode selection (`/mode_selection`): Screen for choosing oscilloscope or spectrum analyzer mode
3. Graph display (`/graph`): The main oscilloscope or spectrum analyzer display

## Theme Application

The file applies the themes defined in `AppTheme.dart`:

```dart
theme: AppTheme.lightTheme,
darkTheme: AppTheme.darkTheme,
themeMode: ThemeMode.light,
```

The application is configured to use light mode by default, but the dark theme is registered to support theme switching.

## Integration with Application Architecture

Within the application architecture,

main.dart

 serves several critical functions:

1. **Application Bootstrap**: Initializes the application environment and launches the UI
2. **Configuration Application**: Applies system-wide settings like orientation and theme
3. **Navigation Setup**: Configures the application's navigation routes
4. **Permission Management**: Ensures the application has necessary runtime permissions
5. **Dependency Coordination**: Coordinates with `Initializer.dart` to ensure all dependencies are ready

By centralizing these responsibilities, the file provides a clean and organized entry point that establishes the core execution environment for the oscilloscope application.
